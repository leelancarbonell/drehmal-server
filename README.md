This server will be running the Drehmal: Apotheosis survival-adventure map. A massive, rich open world with an original storyline, many custom gameplay features, expansive lore, and more. The most recent version of Drehmal is v2.2.2: Apotheosis, built for Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1.

The main page for the map can be found [here](https://www.drehmal.net/), and the wiki page for the map can be found [here](https://wiki.drehmal.cyou/).

## Install Guide
It is recommended that you install the map and the required modpack through the Prism Launcher. The Prism Launcher is an all-in-one launcher that allows you to install modpacks, resource packs, shader packs, maps and extensively configure Minecraft. The map and modpack can easily be found and installed using Modrinth within the launcher. If you have not yet installed the Prism Launcher, the installer can be directly downloaded using the link [here](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/download/10.0.5/PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-Setup-10.0.5.exe).

If this is your first time installing the Prism Launcher, open the header below for instructions on how to log into your Minecraft account.
