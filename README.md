## Drehmal Apotheosis

This server will be running the Drehmal: Apotheosis survival-adventure map. A massive, rich open world with an original storyline, many custom gameplay features, expansive lore, and more. The most recent version of Drehmal is v2.2.2: Apotheosis, built for Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1. 

The main page for the map can be found [here](https://www.drehmal.net/), and the wiki page for the map can be found [here](https://wiki.drehmal.cyou/).

## Install Guide
It is recommended that you install the map and the required modpack through the Prism Launcher. The Prism Launcher is an all-in-one launcher that allows you to install modpacks, resource packs, shader packs, maps and extensively configure Minecraft. The map and modpack can easily be found and installed using Modrinth within the launcher. If you have not yet installed the Prism Launcher, the installer can be directly downloaded using the link [here](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/download/10.0.5/PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-Setup-10.0.5.exe).

If this is your first time installing the Prism Launcher, open the header below for instructions on how to log into your Minecraft account.

  To log into your Minecraft account, you will have to log into the Prism Launcher using the Microsoft account associated with your Minecraft license. Open the Prism Launcher and you should find the Accounts button on the top-right of the application as shown below. Press it and select the option "Manage Accounts..." as shown on the image below.

  The Prism Launcher settings window within the Accounts section should have opened. On the right side of the window, you should see the option to add your Microsoft account labelled "Add Microsoft".

  Once selected, a new window should have opened up that will allow you to log into your Microsoft account. It will allow you to login by either opening a link to manually login with your credentials, or by scanning a QR code or using https://www.microsoft.com/link to enter a code to login. Either option is fine, but both will require you to login to your Microsoft account. The login process may differ for the option you choose, so please follow the directions provided by the login process. 

  **Please ensure that the Microsoft account you are logging into is accociated with a valid Minecraft account. If you use the wrong account, you may receive an error when logging in.**

  Once you are done logging into your Microsoft account, you should see your Minecraft account appear on the Accounts setting. 

  If for any reason you are still having errors when logging into your Microsoft account AND you are certain that the account you are logging into has a valid Minecraft license/account, you may need to try the options below:
  - Ensure that the Microsoft Account you are logging into contains a valid Minecraft license/account. To check if your Microsoft account has one, log into the Minecraft page [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile). This link should show you if you own Minecraft with this account.
  - Log into your Microsoft account and open your account settings using the link [here](https://account.microsoft.com/). On the left side of the webpage, open "Your info". Under "Date of birth", enter a date that would give your account an age over 18.
  - Use your Microsoft account to log into Xbox [here](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/).

  Once you have done the above. Attempt to log into your Microsoft account through the Prism Launcher again. If you are still having issues, let me know.
